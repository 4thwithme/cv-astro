### Summary

I have 8+ years of development experience. My main traits are: problem solving (coding), curiosity, perseverance and empathy. As an engineering manager, in my work I focus on: the product quality and code (because I have high standard expectations from UX/UI), well-organized teamwork, healthy and friendly atmosphere in the team, and the result (result delivered on time). I'm an easily challenged person, the more difficult the task in front of me is, the more enthusiastically I tackle it. I like learning new technologies. Have deep expertise in front end development, back end, databases, UX/UI.
